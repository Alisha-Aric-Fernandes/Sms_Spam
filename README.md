# Sms_Spam
This project introduces an innovative web application built with Streamlit, designed to provide an intuitive
and interactive platform for the classification of emails and SMS messages as either spam or not spam using
machine learning techniques. The core of the application is a Multinomial Naive Bayes model, trained on a
carefully curated dataset, which is equipped with robust text preprocessing methods.
